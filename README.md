## Instructions

You are a group of little elves who all work in a magical workshop. People come in and ask you to make interesting things for them. It's your job to work together and find the right ingredients to make it.

There are a lot of ingredients in your workshop that you can use. See them on the picture cards. On the back of the card you can see what kind of things it does in the mix, but don't look yet! You have to guess what it will do by thinking about the picture.

To make something, you pick two ingredients and put them in the Machine of Magical Making. You always need one thing for the formula part, and one thing for the shaper part. The formula is mixed with the shaper, which makes your magical creation!

To see if it worked, we will turn the cards over and see what the combination is. If you're a very small elf your adult elf will help you to read the back of the cards. We can then see if it works to make what the person wanted. We check by matching the words on the back.

If you didn't guess right don't worry, you can have another go! When you play it again you can try to remember what you learned before.

If you *did* guess it right, that's great! The person who asked you to make it will give you some money and take their thing. You can have more fun by drawing out the thing you made.

Play as many times as you like!

# Example Play

*Note, spoils the surprise of one the first challenge, read only if you don't mind that.*

This is an example of an easy challenge.

### Read aloud, preamble

An adult or older child reads this out loud, provided as a challenge with the game.

> An sad looking witch comes into your shop and rings the bell. "Hello, I need help.", they say with tears in their eyes, "My pet dragon broke my broom and I need it to fly and do my work. Can you make me something new?"

For another optional clue to make it easier, this can be read, emphasising the keywords obviously:

> "You know us witches love to zoom about in the night sky. My broom is very **magical** and when I sit on it I **fly**."

### Choosing cards

All the cards are laid out, picture side up. Children collaborate to choose 2 cards. If there are two kids they can pick one each for example, or if many they can debate which two to pick.

The right combination will be:

* Formula card is **Flying**, so either *Wasp Wing* or *Firefly*
* Shaper card is **Magical**, so either *Rainbow light*, *Unicorn poo* or *Crystal*
* See in the dark / night vision: rabbit, owl, cat

In this example, the children chose Firefly and Crystal.

### Mixing the ingredients

Ask the children to wave their hands for the magic, or wands or whatever way they like to invoke their magic.

The cards are turned over to reveal a short list of description words on the back and see if they match.

### Reflect on creation

Ask the children to describe what thing actually gets made. If they are stumped you can suggest one of the prewritten ideas, such as in this case, a **crystal broom with wings**.

### Read aloud, postamble

(Note, postamble only written for success case. Read aloud)

> "Here your **crystal broom with wings**", you say. The witch looks happy now. "Oh my, how unusual! But I love it. Thank you, so much, I'm going to fly on it right now!" The witch hands you some money.

You can use any little tokens, or even sweets for money.

### Draw the creation

As an optional but encouraged last step, the children can draw how they think the creation looks in their imagination. For younger kids especially this is good for the flow of the game to have periods of intensity together, and then less intensity thinking and doing on their own.
