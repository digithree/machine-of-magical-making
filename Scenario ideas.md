## Scenario ideas

Someone wants to be able to breathe under water

A sailor gets too tired rowing their boat and wants something to push it on the water

A family wants Xmas tree lights (but doesn't want to set their tree on fire!)

A cow wants sunglasses

Santa forgot his magic to get down chimneys, and needs something to help him fit through them

Something to change their colour of plants to rainbow colours

A magic sword is tired of hurting their friends and wants a coat [sheath] (but it can't be sticky)

A crow lost it's voice and wants something that makes a sound instead (and it has to be rough sounding)

## Challenge types to solve

1. Well known animals or fictional characters that want to resume doing what they always do after some problem (e.g. a witch flying)
2. Help in doing their normal thing typical thing (e.g. a sailor sailing), making part of it easier
3. Stopping something mildly bad or annoying happening a person or creature, e.g. theft, sensory aversion, waking up in night, etc.

## Difficulty levels, by adding / removing supports

In order of minimum info to maximum. Only using first is hardest, up to using all info is easiest:

* Basic description
* Shaper is given
* Clue about active type

Additional difficulty in active type to avoid

# Problems

Many solution ideas are:

* Too straight forward, i.e. crow that wants a voice
